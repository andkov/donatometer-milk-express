# About 

[Milk Express][me] is a volunteer service delivering dairy products to wounded soldiers in rehabilitation hospitals, to children in oncology hospitals, and forces of territorial defense. Started after the first invasion in 2014, Milk Express delivered thousands of gallons of milk, kefir, and yogurt. 

With the avalanche of casualties after the latest Russian invasion in February 24, 2022,  Milk Express is busier than ever, now expanding to other foods and locations, responding to emerging needs.  Operating from Kyiv, Milk Express brings palpable, tasty, nutritious love to those who need it most.
